#Project Management with GitHub

##The README
* outlines immediately relevant developer information such as:
 * quick overview of the project
 * how to get started developing
 * information about the directory structure
 * development process
 * environments
 * links to where to find more information
 * ex: boiler-plate

##Issues

###Association and Back Reference

_Issues can be associated with each other by simply throwing a #[issue-number] (ex: #3) within the body of another issue. This is useful in many ways. Firstly, it keeps the relationship simple. We don't have to worry about what kind of relationship it is (parent/sibling) just that it's related. However, there are a couple of tricks that make this a little more useful if you understand how it works, so let me give you an example._

_Let's say you typically create user stories, and from these user stories you break it out into individual issues for each of the various tasks that need to be completed in order to satisfy this user story. Here's an example:_

###Tags

_Tags are a simple and effective way to add meta data to your issues. A lot of systems tend to create fields and categories with various values in a effort to allow you to have finite control of the meta data on an issue, but I've found the simple tagging system that GitHub employs to be very efficient and extremely flexible._

_Github comes with a few by default: bug, duplicate, enhancement, invalid, question, and won't fix. These give you a good idea of how to start using them. For example, "bug" is a type of issue, while "won't fix" is more of a status. Tags can be anything, and if chosen wisely, can give any developer an immediate clue as to what sort of ticket it is, what section it might apply to, or what status it is in at a quick glance._

_But while they're useful for developers, they're also good for the organizer, in that they serve as a great filtering mechanism as well. For instance, just by selecting various tags, I can see all of the issues that are "migration" issues for "taxonomy", or "content types"._
